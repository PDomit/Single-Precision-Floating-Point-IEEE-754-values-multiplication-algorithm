# Single-Precision-Floating-Point-IEEE-754-values-multiplication-ARM-algorithm
The function returns a result of a multiplication of two single precision floating point values (IEEE 754).
To use the function in your code you have to:
1) Add the file to your workspace:

2) Write the prototype of the function (I use uint32_t as a type of returning values because I need to do some logical operations on the results. This is still the same value, but compiler allows me to do some logic operations):
